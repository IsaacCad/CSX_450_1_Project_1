# CSX_450_1_Project_1 The Data Science Toolkit

## Goal

Create a detailed outline of the steps required to configure your own Jupyter Data Science Notebook Server on Amazon Web Services. The idea is that you would be able to revisit these instructions some arbitrary amount of time from now and be able to bring the server online without consulting any additional documentation.

You will need to account for:

SSH keys
Amazon EC 2
Security Groups
AWS Operating System
Docker Installation
Obtaining the correct Docker image
Running the correct Docker image as a container
Jupyter notebook security concerns
Anything else I may have forgotten ...
Create at least one diagram of your overall system.
A detailed budget of the costs of running a Jupyter Data Science Notebook Server for three months using at least three different kinds of EC 2 instances.
